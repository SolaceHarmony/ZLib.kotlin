**ZLib.kotlin** is a pure Kotlin Native port of the legendary ZLib compression library, tracing its lineage from the C#/.NET project [zlib.managed](https://github.com/philippelatulippe/ZLIB.NET), itself a fork of the original [zlib.net](http://www.componentace.com/zlib_.NET.htm). This library brings high-performance, cross-platform compression and decompression capabilities to the Kotlin ecosystem, embracing multiplatform development with modern tooling.

## About

ZLib.kotlin is part of **The Solace Project** special libraries, designed to offer reliable, efficient compression for Kotlin Native targets. It is a complete rewrite in pure Kotlin, ensuring safety, maintainability, and native performanceâ€”without JNI, C interop, or external dependencies.

This library was originally ported from the C#/.NET [zlib.managed](https://github.com/philippelatulippe/ZLIB.NET) project (a fork of zlib.net by ComponentAce), which itself is based on the seminal C library written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

---

## Features

- **Pure Kotlin/Native implementation:** No C/C++ code or JNI required.
- **Multiplatform support:** Kotlin Native for Linux and macOS targets.
- **API compatible:** Designed to be familiar to users of zlib, zlib.net, or zlib.managed.
- **Fast and lightweight:** Efficient, battle-tested algorithms for compression and decompression.
- **Zero dependencies:** No need for external libraries or system zlib installs.
- **Actively maintained:** Open to improvements and contributions.

---

## Installation

Add ZLib.kotlin to your project with Gradle:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.solaceharmony:zlib.kotlin:<latest-version>")
}
```

Or, for multiplatform projects:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("com.solaceharmony:zlib.kotlin:<latest-version>")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** Replace `<latest-version>` with the latest published version on Maven Central or your chosen repository.

---

## Usage

Here's a simple example of compressing and decompressing a `ByteArray`:

```kotlin
import com.solaceharmony.zlib.kotlin.ZLib

val data: ByteArray = "Hello, ZLib.kotlin!".encodeToByteArray()

// Compress
val compressed: ByteArray = ZLib.compress(data)

// Decompress
val decompressed: ByteArray = ZLib.decompress(compressed)

println(decompressed.decodeToString()) // Output: Hello, ZLib.kotlin!
```

For more advanced usage, streaming, or custom options, see the detailed [API documentation](docs/API.md) and practical [examples](examples/).

## Documentation

### ðŸ“š [API Reference](docs/API.md)
Comprehensive API documentation covering:
- Core classes (`ZStream`, `ZInputStream`, `ZStreamException`)
- Compression and decompression methods
- Configuration options and constants
- Advanced usage patterns
- Error handling and performance tips

### ðŸ’¡ [Examples](examples/)
Practical examples demonstrating:
- **Basic compression/decompression** - Simple operations with error handling
- **Advanced techniques** - Performance comparison, streaming, custom parameters
- **Best practices** - Memory management, buffer sizing, optimization tips

---

## Compatibility

- **Kotlin/Native:** Linux, macOS

Tested with IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle.

---

## Testing

Run the multiplatform tests using Gradle. For example, to execute the Linux x64
tests run:

```bash
./gradlew linuxX64Test
```

Native targets have their own `<target>Test` task (e.g., `./gradlew macosArm64Test`). 
macOS target tasks may be disabled when running on a non-macOS host.

### Attribution

This library is an original Kotlin Multiplatform implementation maintained by Sydney Bach / The Solace Project.
It is inspired by and acknowledges the original zlib work by Jeanâ€‘loup Gailly and Mark Adler. Any remaining
references to legacy code paths were removed during the rewrite; the streaming inflate presented here is a
clean, Kotlinâ€‘native implementation that adheres to the zlib format (RFC 1950) and DEFLATE specification (RFC 1951).
