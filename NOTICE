Attribution and Background
- This library is a clean-room rewrite based on RFC 1950 (ZLIB format) and RFC 1951 (DEFLATE). It is not a direct port of zlib or any C# project.
- The original zlib library was authored by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler. Their work informed the format and algorithms this implementation targets.
- The C#/.NET implementations (zlib.net / zlib.managed) served as useful references during development.
